# Predicting Daily Rainfall in New South Wales

The main goal of this project is working with web and cloud computing realted to big data. Big data is a collection of massive and complex data sets and data volume that include the huge quantities of data, data management capabilities, social media analytics and real-time data. Along with the explosion of information, it becomes more and more enssential to better manage and work with big data. In this project, we will build and deploy ensemble machine learning models in the cloud to predict daily rainfall in Australia on a large dataset (~6 GB), where features are outputs of different climate models, and the target is the actual rainfall observation.

## Data

The data we are using is [Daily rainfall over NSW, Australia](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Daily_rainfall_over_NSW_Australia/14096681?file=26586554), which contains modelled and observed daily rainfall data from 1889 to 2014 over NSW, Australia.
